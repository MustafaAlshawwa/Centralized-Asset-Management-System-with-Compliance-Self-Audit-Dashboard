# Centralized-Asset-Management-System-with-Compliance-Self-Audit-Dashboard
## Overview

This project is a **centralized dashboard** designed for an **Asset Management System** that includes key security features such as:

- **Security Assessment**
- **Compliance Checks** based on **CIS Benchmarks**
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** using sensitive data protection mechanisms

The dashboard provides real-time data and helps ensure compliance and security across different assets.

## Technology Stack

The project utilizes **two Linux machines** and **two Windows machines**, set up as follows:

- **Linux Machines** (Using Vagrant):
  - **Ubuntu Desktop**
  - **Ubuntu Server**

- **Windows Machines**:
  - **Windows 10**
  - **Windows 11**

The centralized dashboard is powered by **Node.js** and built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, making it fully responsive and capable of displaying **live data** from the assets.

## Features

- **Security Assessment**: Conducts continuous checks to ensure the integrity and security of managed assets.
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Automatically checks for compliance with industry standards such as the **CIS Benchmarks**.
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**: Leverages sensitive data protection techniques to prevent unauthorized data exposure.

## Dashboard

The dashboard is built using:

- **Node.js**: Backend functionality for handling real-time data and system processes.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend designed for responsiveness, offering a seamless user experience across various devices.

## Deployment

The system is virtualized using **Vagrant** to easily provision and manage the following machines:

1. **Ubuntu Desktop**
2. **Ubuntu Server** 
3. **Windows 10**
4. **Windows 11**

Each machine is configured to integrate with the dashboard, providing live data on asset security, compliance, and DLP status.
